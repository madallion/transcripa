Transcribe some languages in the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). The goal is to help those who are first learning a language or want to be able to read things more easily to have something that a) [romanizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization) the native script if necessary, and b) puts it into more-or-less correct IPA transcription to more accurately represent pronunciation and the differences between languages.

I have several languages working passably right now, the full list of which is [available here](Introduction.md).
